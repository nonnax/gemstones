{## Garnet Birthstone Meaning & History}

The name “garnet” originates from the medieval Latin granatus, meaning 
“pomegranate,” in reference to the similarity of the red color. Garnets 
have been used since the Bronze Age as gemstones and abrasives. Necklaces 
studded with red garnets adorned the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. Signet rings in 
ancient Rome featured garnet intaglios that were used to stamp the wax that 
secured important documents. The clergy and nobility of the Middle Ages had a 
preference for red garnets.

were used to stamp the wax that secured important documents. The clergy and 
nobility preferred red garnets.

Garnet is actually a group of several minerals. Five of these – pyrope, 
almandine, spessartine, grossular and andradite – are important as gems. 
Pyrope and almandine range from purple to red. Spessartine is found in exciting 
oranges and yellows, while andradite is mostly yellow to green (the gem variety 
demantoid). Grossular may have the widest range, from colorless through yellow 
to reddish orange and orangy red, as well as a strong vibrant green called 
tsavorite.

The Smithsonian’s antique pyrope hair comb is one of the most famous pieces 
of garnet jewelry (pyrope is from the Greek pyrōpos, which means 
“fiery-eyed”). A large rose-cut garnet sits at the crest, much like a queen 
serenely surveying her court. The pyrope garnets that decorate this tiara-like 
jewel came from the historic mines in Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic), 
and these rich red beauties were extremely popular during the Victorian era 
(1837–1901), when this piece was fashioned.

Curious about your garnet birthstone’s reputed health benefits? According to 
Indian astrology, garnet helps eliminate negative feelings (depression, guilt) 
and instill greater self-confidence and mental clarity to promote creative 
thinking and peace of mind. In ancient and medieval times, gems like garnet 
were also thought to be remedies for inflammatory diseases and to soothe the 
angry heart.

{## Where is Garnet Found?}

Garnets come from many different regions and countries. Bohemia was the primary 
source of the red pyrope garnets so popular during Victorian times. In 19th 
century Russia, green demantoid garnets from the Ural Mountains were prized by 
the Russian royal family and used by the great jeweler Peter Carl Fabergé 
(1846–1920). Today, the African continent supplies much of the world’s 
garnet. Namibia is now producing demantoids, and most of the bright green 
tsavorites in the market come from Kenya, Tanzania and Madagascar.

{## Garnet Birthstone Care & Cleaning}

The different types of garnet range between 6.5 and 7.5 on the Mohs scale of 
hardness. This means that this birthstone is more susceptible to damage than 
rubies, sapphires and diamonds. So while not all garnets are good candidates 
for daily wear, they are ideal for earrings, brooches and pendants. Give 
thought to how you store your garnet jewelry. If you let it rub against harder 
gems – again, think diamonds, rubies and sapphires – it can be scratched.

against them, it can be scratched.}

And in turn garnet can scratch softer gems, such as opals or pearls.

Most garnets are not treated. Rarely, however, some garnets might be fracture 
filled, whereby treaters try to improve the apparent clarity of the gem by 
filling surface-reaching breaks with a glass-like substance. Such treated 
stones require special care. {It is always safe to use a soft brush with warm 
soapy water. Ultrasonic cleaners are usually safe, except for stones that have 
been fractured. It's not a good idea to steam clean.}

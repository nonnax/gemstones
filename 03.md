[## Aquamarine Birthstone Meaning & History]

[Ancient mariners believed that aquamarine would calm waves and keep sailors safe at sea. The March birthstone was thought to bring happiness in marriage.] Beryl was believed to give the wearer protection against foes in battle and litigation. [It was thought to make the wearer unconquerable and amiable, and quickens the intellect.]

[On the 19th wedding anniversary, aquamarine is given as a present because it is the birthstone for March.] As for famous ones, in 1936 the government of Brazil gave First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt a dark blue rectangular step cut aquamarine that weighed 1,298 carats (ct). It was the larger of two stones faceted from a piece of aquamarine rough that itself weighed an impressive 2.9 pounds (1.3 kilograms). It is now housed at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, New York. A celebrated attraction at the Smithsonian Institution is the 10,363 ct (about 4.6 pounds) Dom Pedro Aquamarine – believed to be the largest faceted aquamarine in the world. The approximately 14 inch (36 centimeter) high obelisk was fashioned by acclaimed German lapidary Berndt Munsteiner using the fantasy cut technique.

[## Where is Aquamarine Found?]

[The state of Minas Gerais in Brazil has supplied aquamarine for two centuries.] Travel there and you’ll find a changing panorama of landscapes: rocky hills, rivers and scrub brush dominate the central and eastern regions; savannahs, forests and streams checker the west; and lush green hills roll southward. Aquamarines are found in primary (hard rock) and secondary (weathered) pegmatite deposits in the eastern portion of the state, near the gem center of Teófilo Otoni.

[Aquamarine is also found high in the foothills of Pakistan.] To reach the deposits, miners must climb steep paths to elevations of 9,800 to 13,000+ feet (3,000 to more than 4,000 meters) and work the sides of forbidding cliffs. Below this inhospitable rocky world lie fertile valleys, rushing rivers and small towns. Aquamarine from this area has been described as “water clear.”

Aquamarine birthstones are also mined in Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria, Zambia and Mozambique, as well as elsewhere in Africa. U.S. sources include the Mount Antero area of Colorado (it’s the state gem) and California’s Riverside and San Diego counties. In addition, aquamarine has been found in China, Myanmar, Russia and Ukraine, among other countries.

[## Aquamarine Birthstone Care & Cleaning]

[The March birthstone has a hard surface of 7.5-8 on the Mohs scale. It's easy to care for the gem. To clean behind the birthstone, use warm water, dish soap and a toothbrush.] Ultrasonic cleaners and steam cleaning are usually safe options as long as there are no fractures or liquid inclusions in the gem.

Pearl Birthstone
{## Pearl Birthstone Meaning & History}
{![Pearl](pearl-cultured-freshwater-pearls-900x507.png)}

{The Pearl birthstone is from oceans, lakes and rivers. It is a wardrobe staple 
that women of all ages love. Our forebears were fascinated by the origin of 
pearls. Pearls were thought to be from heaven. The Chinese believed that this 
June birthstone came from the brain of a dragon.} Christopher Columbus and his 
contemporaries thought that mollusks formed pearls from dew drops.

{Pearls are gems that grow inside a living saltwater or freshwater mollusk 
(either an oyster or a mussel).} Natural pearls form when the mollusk secretes 
a substance called nacre around an irritant such as a piece of sand or a 
parasite that has invaded its shell. Cultured pearls are a product of human 
intervention. Technicians implant a piece of mantle tissue alone (common for 
freshwater cultured pearls) or with a mother-of-pearl shell bead (all 
saltwater) into a host mollusk. The mollusk covers the irritant with nacre, 
just like a natural pearl. {Cultured pearls are raised in saltwater or 
freshwater pearl farms where the mollusks are cleaned and protected from 
predators. There are a variety of sizes, colors and shapes of cultured pearls.} Thousands of years of pearl fishing have decimated the natural 
pearl beds, so cultured pearls account for the vast majority of pearl sales 
today. 

{*Pearls have long been associated with purity, humility and innocence.* So, traditionally pearls were a wedding gift.} 
So it may be said that the June birthstone meaning is "sweet simplicity." 


The pearl birthstone was also thought to have beneficial properties. {Pearls 
were said to bring long life and prosperity in the ancient Sanskrit text. In 
Asia, Pearls were believed to cure indigestion and hemorrhages. The 19th 
century Arab physicians claimed that pearl powder alleviated depression and 
improved eyesight.}

One of the most famous natural pearls is the 50.56 carat (ct) La Peregrina. 
About the size of a pigeon’s egg, the drop shaped pearl was discovered in the 
1500s in the Gulf of Panama. It became a prized possession of European royalty. 
Richard Burton eventually gifted it to Elizabeth Taylor in 1969; Christie’s 
New York auctioned the Cartier necklace containing La Peregrina for $11.8 
million in 2011.

{## Where are Pearls Found?}

Warm waters… clear skies… dramatic scenery – it sounds like a dream beach 
vacation, don’t you think? It’s also an accurate description of where 
you'll often find these pearl birthstones. Pearl-bearing mollusks fail to 
thrive in polluted waters, so pearl farms are usually located far from 
civilization – and often in breathtaking settings.

{In Japan, China, Australia, Indonesia, Philippines and the southern coast of 
Southeast Asia are some of the places where saltwater cultured pearls are 
grown.} Akoya cultured pearl farms are primarily found in Japan and China, 
especially along the southern coasts of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. South 
Sea cultured pearls are farmed from the northern coast of Australia through 
Indonesia to the southern coast of Southeast Asia, with large operations in the 
Philippines as well. The Gambier Islands and the Tuamotu Archipelago, both part 
of French Polynesia, are two locales where the rich black Tahitian pearls are 
cultured. {China is the dominant source of freshwater cultured pearls.}

{While Natural pearls were found in the Arabian Gulf for at least 5,000 years, 
divers have been recovering the June birthstone from the Red Sea since 300 BC. 
Pearls have been provided by the Strait of Mannar since 2000. Large quantities 
of pearls were recovered from the waters off Mexico, Central America and 
Venezuela during the 16th century. There are only a small amount of pearls in 
these areas today.}

{## Pearl Birthstone Care & Cleaning}

{At 2.5 to 3.0 on the Mohs Scale of hardness, pearls are soft and need special 
care. They should be kept separate from other gemstones and metal jewelry. 
Plastic can emit a chemical that will damage the pearl's surface, so never 
store it in a plastic bag. Apply makeup, hair products, and perfume, before 
putting on jewelry.}

{The best way to clean your June birthstone is to use a soft, damp cloth after 
each time the pearls are worn.}

Moonstone Birthstone
{## Moonstone Birthstone Meaning & History}
{![Moonstone](moonstone-ring-750x750.png)}

Moonstone is the best-known gem of the feldspar group of minerals. {Moonstone 
is 
renowned for its adularescence, the light that appears to billow across a 
gemstone, giving it a special glow. The finest moonstones show a blue sheen 
against a colorless background. This June birthstone has been associated with 
both the Roman and Greek lunar deities. Hindu mythology claims that it is made 
of solidified moonbeams.} 

{*Moonstone is often associated with love, passion and 
fertility; it is believed to bring great luck.*}

Great designers of the Art Nouveau era (1890s–1910s), such as René Lalique 
and Louis Comfort Tiffany, featured moonstone in their fine jewelry. The 
moonstone birthstone came to the forefront again during the 1960s “flower 
child” movement and with New Age designers of the 1990s.

The June birthstone is featured in a Frankish disk brooch from the second half 
7th century made of gold sheet, filigree, moonstone, glass cabochons, garnets, 
mother-of-pearl, and moonstone.

{## Where is Moonstone Found?}

Moonstone can be found in a wide variety of places. {India and Sri Lanka are 
the most important world locations for the moonstone. Moonstone can be found in 
parts of the United States,  Brazil, Madagascar, Myanmar and Tanzania. }

{## Moonstone Birthstone Care & Cleaning}

{Moonstone has mild toughness and is a 6 on the Mohs scale. It may crack under 
high heat. Ultrasonic and steam cleaners shouldn't be used on your moonstone. 
Warm soapy water with a soft brush is the best way to clean it.}

Alexandrite Birthstone
{## Alexandrite Birthstone Meaning & History}
{![Alexandrite](alexandrite-ring-750x750.png)}

Alexandrite is the rare variety of the mineral chrysoberyl that changes color 
in different lighting. {The alexandrite birthstones show a vivid green to 
bluish green in daylight or fluorescent light, and an intense red to purplish 
red in the same light.} Major alexandrite deposits were first discovered in 
1830 in Russia’s Ural Mountains. 

{Alexandrite was named after the young Alexander II (1818–1881), the heir 
apparent to the Russian throne. The country was interested in the resemblance 
of the red and green colors to the military colors of Russia.}

When certain types of long, thin inclusions are oriented parallel to each other 
in this June birthstone, they can create another phenomenon, called chatoyancy 
or the cat’s-eye effect. Few gems are as fascinating – or as stunning – 
as cat’s-eye alexandrite.

{## Where is Alexandrite Found?}

{Alexandrite comes from Brazil, Sri Lanka and East Africa. The Ural Mountain 
deposits were eventually mined out.}

{The newer deposits contain some fine-quality stones, but they are not as bright as the 19th century Russian Alexandrites.}

{Because of scarcity, fine-quality Alexandrite is one of the more expensive 
colored gems.}

{## Alexandrite Birthstone Care & Cleaning}

{This June birthstone is relatively hard—8.5 on the Mohs scale. It has 
excellent toughness and no cleavage, which is a tendency to break when struck. 
This makes it a good choice for rings and other mountings subject to daily 
wear.}

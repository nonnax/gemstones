<p>If you were born in the month of June, you will have three of your own.</p>

<p><img src="pearl-cultured-freshwater-pearls-900x507.png" alt="Pearl" /></p>

<p>The Pearl birthstone is from oceans, lakes and rivers. It is a wardrobe staple 
that women of all ages love. Our forebears were fascinated by the origin of 
pearls. Pearls were thought to be from heaven. The Chinese believed that this 
June birthstone came from the brain of a dragon.</p>

<p>Pearls are gems that grow inside a living saltwater or freshwater mollusk 
(either an oyster or a mussel).</p>

<p>Cultured pearls are raised in saltwater or 
freshwater pearl farms where the mollusks are cleaned and protected from 
predators. There are a variety of sizes, colors and shapes of cultured pearls.</p>

<p><em>Pearls have long been associated with purity, humility and innocence.</em> So, traditionally pearls were a wedding gift.</p>

<p>Pearls 
were said to bring long life and prosperity in the ancient Sanskrit text. In 
Asia, Pearls were believed to cure indigestion and hemorrhages. The 19th 
century Arab physicians claimed that pearl powder alleviated depression and 
improved eyesight.</p>

<h2 id="where-are-pearls-found">Where are Pearls Found?</h2>

<p>In Japan, China, Australia, Indonesia, Philippines and the southern coast of 
Southeast Asia are some of the places where saltwater cultured pearls are 
grown.</p>

<p>China is the dominant source of freshwater cultured pearls.</p>

<p>While Natural pearls were found in the Arabian Gulf for at least 5,000 years, 
divers have been recovering the June birthstone from the Red Sea since 300 BC. 
Pearls have been provided by the Strait of Mannar since 2000. Large quantities 
of pearls were recovered from the waters off Mexico, Central America and 
Venezuela during the 16th century. There are only a small amount of pearls in 
these areas today.</p>

<h2 id="pearl-birthstone-care--cleaning">Pearl Birthstone Care &amp; Cleaning</h2>

<p>At 2.5 to 3.0 on the Mohs Scale of hardness, pearls are soft and need special 
care. They should be kept separate from other gemstones and metal jewelry. 
Plastic can emit a chemical that will damage the pearl’s surface, so never 
store it in a plastic bag. Apply makeup, hair products, and perfume, before 
putting on jewelry.</p>

<p>The best way to clean your June birthstone is to use a soft, damp cloth after 
each time the pearls are worn.</p>

<p><img src="moonstone-ring-750x750.png" alt="Moonstone" /></p>

<p>Moonstone 
is 
renowned for its adularescence, the light that appears to billow across a 
gemstone, giving it a special glow. The finest moonstones show a blue sheen 
against a colorless background. This June birthstone has been associated with 
both the Roman and Greek lunar deities. Hindu mythology claims that it is made 
of solidified moonbeams.</p>

<p><em>Moonstone is often associated with love, passion and 
fertility; it is believed to bring great luck.</em></p>

<h2 id="where-is-moonstone-found">Where is Moonstone Found?</h2>

<p>India and Sri Lanka are 
the most important world locations for the moonstone. Moonstone can be found in 
parts of the United States,  Brazil, Madagascar, Myanmar and Tanzania.</p>

<h2 id="moonstone-birthstone-care--cleaning">Moonstone Birthstone Care &amp; Cleaning</h2>

<p>Moonstone has mild toughness and is a 6 on the Mohs scale. It may crack under 
high heat. Ultrasonic and steam cleaners shouldn’t be used on your moonstone. 
Warm soapy water with a soft brush is the best way to clean it.</p>

<h2 id="alexandrite-birthstone-meaning--history">Alexandrite Birthstone Meaning &amp; History</h2>

<p><img src="alexandrite-ring-750x750.png" alt="Alexandrite" /></p>

<p>The alexandrite birthstones show a vivid green to 
bluish green in daylight or fluorescent light, and an intense red to purplish 
red in the same light.</p>

<p>Alexandrite was named after the young Alexander II (1818–1881), the heir 
apparent to the Russian throne. The country was interested in the resemblance 
of the red and green colors to the military colors of Russia.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-alexandrite-found">Where is Alexandrite Found?</h2>

<p>Alexandrite comes from Brazil, Sri Lanka and East Africa. The Ural Mountain 
deposits were eventually mined out.</p>

<p>The newer deposits contain some fine-quality stones, but they are not as bright as the 19th century Russian Alexandrites.</p>

<p>Because of scarcity, fine-quality Alexandrite is one of the more expensive 
colored gems.</p>

<p>This June birthstone is relatively hard—8.5 on the Mohs scale. It has 
excellent toughness and no cleavage, which is a tendency to break when struck. 
This makes it a good choice for rings and other mountings subject to daily 
wear.</p>

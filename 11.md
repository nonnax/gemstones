{# November Birthstone : Topaz and Citrine }
The two November birthstones are Topaz (the pink and orange gems) and Citrine 
(the yellow gem).

Those with November birthdays have two beautiful birthstones to choose from: 
topaz and citrine. {Topaz comes in a rainbow of colors; Citrine is prized for its 
bright yellow and orange colors. Both November birthstones bring fortune and 
warmth to the wearer.} 
Most topaz and citrine birthstones are affordably priced, as good-quality gems 
are not as rare as for many of their counterparts. This means that those born 
in November have many options to choose from. Your challenge will be deciding 
which one to pick.

Topaz Birthstone
{## Topaz Birthstone Meaning & History}

{The variety of topaz colors include blue, yellow, orange, pink, violet, brown, and red. The majority of blue topaz today is because it is treated with irradiation and heating. The rainbow effect is created by coating topaz with a thin artificial film.}

{The Sanskrit word for fire is called tapas and is believed to be the origin of the word topaz. Others say it came from the Greek topazos.} This November 
birthstone was long thought to have many benefits. {The ancient Greeks believed that topaz gave them strength. Europeans thought it could clear anger and ward off magic spells. India believes that topaz worn above the heart assures long life, beauty and intelligence.}

The distinctly pinkish orange Imperial topaz has aristocratic cachet. It is 
commonly believed that the name originated with the Russian royal family’s 
insistence on keeping the finest colors of this gem, which was mined in 
Russia’s Ural Mountains, exclusively for their use. An alternate explanation, 
especially popular in Brazil, is that it dates from an 1881 visit by Brazilian 
Emperor Pedro II to Ouro Preto—the town closest to Brazil’s most productive 
topaz mines–and the gift of a reddish topaz to him.

Blue topaz is the gem of the fourth wedding anniversary, and Imperial topaz is 
the gem of the 23rd wedding anniversary.

{## Where Is Topaz Found?}

Minas Gerais, a state in Brazil, is one of the most important sources for 
high-quality topaz, which has been mined there for more than two centuries. 
Yellow to orange, red, pink, violet and blends of red with orange or purple are 
some of the colors unearthed here. The nearby town of Ouro Preto is a fitting 
companion. In this UNESCO world heritage site, majestic colonial churches 
checker the skyline and quaint cobblestone streets crisscross the city.

Northwestern Pakistan is known for producing pink topaz. Ghundao Hill, close to 
the small town of Katlang, has been mined since 1972. The most sought-after 
shade of pink topaz from Katlang has a tinge of violet, which some in the gem 
trade call cyclamen pink. But even at Ghundao Hill, only rarely is this fine 
pink November birthstone found.

Today, other major sources of this November birthstone include Namibia, 
Nigeria, Madagascar, Mexico, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and the United States, as well 
as the historic Russian localities.
{## Topaz Birthstone Care & Cleaning}

Topaz is an 8 on the Mohs scale of hardness, but it has poor toughness, so care 
is required to avoid chipping or cracking. To clean this November birthstone, 
do not use steam cleaning or ultrasonic cleaners. Warm, soapy water works best. 
High heat or sudden temperature changes can cause internal breaks in topaz. The 
birthstone’s color is generally stable to light, but prolonged exposure to 
heat or sunlight might cause fading in some yellow-to-brown gems. Topaz may be 
affected slightly by some chemicals.

The coating on Mystic Topaz can withstand normal wear, but abrasive cleaners or 
buffing wheels will remove it. Only a mild soap solution should be used to 
clean a topaz birthstone treated in this manner.

Colorless topaz from Nigeria, light blue topaz from Brazil, purplish-pink topaz 
from Pakistan, and orange-red topaz from Brazil exhibit the multiple colors of 
the November birthstone.

Citrine Birthstone
{## Citrine Birthstone Meaning & History}

This November birthstone is the transparent yellow to brownish orange variety 
of quartz, which has been used in jewelry for thousands of years. Citrine has 
been a popular gemstone since ancient times and has shared a history of 
mistaken identities with the other November birthstone, topaz. As a result, 
people thought citrine had the same powers as topaz. They believed the citrine 
birthstone could soothe tempers and calm the wearer.

The ancient Greeks carved rock crystal ornaments that glistened like 
permafrost. Roman pontiffs wore rings set with massive purple amethysts, and 
citrine has been reported in Roman jewelry. It was particularly popular in 
colorful Scottish jewelry from the Victorian era. Citrine, believed to derive 
from the French word for “lemon” (citron), is given for the thirteenth 
wedding anniversary.

Today, most of the citrine in the marketplace results from the heat treatment 
of amethyst. With its ready availability in a broad range of sizes, citrine 
birthstone is one of the most affordable and desired yellow gemstones.

{## Where Is Citrine Found?}

The top sources for this November birthstone are Bolivia, Spain, Madagascar, 
Mexico and Uruguay. Amethyst that’s typically heat treated to a citrine color 
is mined mostly in Brazil.

Deep in the world’s largest freshwater wetland lies Bolivia’s Anahí mine, 
an important source for natural, unheated citrine. Fields of wildflowers, 
brightly plumed birds, kaleidoscopes of butterflies, Howler monkeys and jaguars 
are some of the actors on this vast stage. The story of the mine is worthy of 
the setting. Discovered by a Spanish conquistador in the 1600s, it was given to 
him as dowry when he married Anahí, a princess from the Ayoreos tribe of 
Paraguay. The mine was lost for three centuries until it was rediscovered in 
the 1960s.
A miner shines a light to reveal thousands of purple amethyst and yellow 
citrine crystals lining the walls of the Anahí mine in Bolivia, where the 
November birthstone can be found.

The Anahí mine produces a unique combination of amethyst and citrine in the 
same crystal; when the two colors appear together in a fashioned gem, it is 
known as ametrine. The citrine birthstones produced at the Anahí mine 
typically range from orange-yellow to brownish/greenish yellow.

birthstone.

{## Citrine Birthstone Care & Cleaning}

At 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness with good toughness, your citrine birthstone 
is usually durable enough for normal wear and care. It can be safely cleaned 
with warm, soapy water. While it is usually okay to clean your November 
birthstone in an ultrasonic machine, steam cleaning is risky since high heat 
could cause the stone to crack.

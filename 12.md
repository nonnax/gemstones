Turquoise Birthstone
Turquoise Birthstone Meaning & History

Turquoise is a semi-translucent to opaque gem that ranges from blue to green 
and often has veins of matrix (remnants of the rock in which it formed) running 
through it. This December birthstone has been cherished for millennia. The 
pharaohs and other rulers of ancient Egypt adorned themselves with it. Chinese 
artisans carved it more than 3,000 years ago.

The turquoise birthstone was thought to possess many beneficial powers, like 
guaranteeing health and good fortune. From the 13th century on, it was believed 
to protect the wearer from falling (especially off horses), and would break 
into several pieces at the approach of disaster. Hindu mystics maintained that 
seeing a turquoise after beholding the new moon ensured fantastic wealth.

This turquoise birthstone also played an important role in the lives of Native 
Americans. The Apache thought turquoise could be found by following a rainbow 
to its end. They also believed that attaching the December birthstone to a bow 
or firearm made one’s aim more accurate. The Pueblo maintained that turquoise 
got its color from the sky, while the Hopi thought the gem was produced by 
lizards scurrying over the earth.

This December birthstone adorns the funerary mask of King Tut, who ruled Egypt 
more than 3,000 years ago. It also appears in jewelry belonging to more modern 
royalty: Wallace Simpson (1896–1986), Duchess of Windsor (the woman for whom 
King Edward VIII gave up his throne), wore a famous amethyst and turquoise 
necklace made by Cartier. Turquoise is also the gem of the 11th wedding 
anniversary.

In European tradition, the gift of a turquoise ring means “forget me not.” 
Turquoise is considered a national treasure in Tibet, where it is believed to 
grant health, good fortune and protection from evil. December's birthstone also 
imparts peace to those who wear it.
Where Is Turquoise Found?

Turquoise has been mined in the Nishapur district of Iran for more than 1,000 
years. The prized even-colored, intense blue turquoise from this region is 
dubbed “robin’s egg blue,” “sky blue” and “Persian blue.” Trade 
professionals now use these terms to describe turquoise of this color – 
regardless of the source.

Although New Mexico was the largest producer of turquoise in the U.S. until the 
1920s, today most of the U.S. production of this December birthstone comes from 
Arizona and Nevada. Mines have evocative names like Dry Creek, Easter Blue, 
Emerald Valley and Fox. The Kingman mine in Arizona is a historically important 
source that is known for producing intense blue turquoise. Now closed to 
turquoise mining, Arizona’s Sleeping Beauty mine was a prolific producer for 
more than four decades.

Today, China is the world’s largest producer of this December birthstone. 
Hubei Province, in central China, is the source of most of the gem-quality 
turquoise currently being mined there.
Turquoise Birthstone Care & Cleaning

Some turquoise is treated to improve its durability (it has a Mohs hardness of 
5 to 6), appearance and polish. Turquoise can be dyed or chemically enhanced by 
adding an epoxy or acrylic resin for greater hardness or better color. Also 
seen are cavities filled with a metal-loaded epoxy to imitate pyrite inclusions.

Turquoise is generally stable to light, but high heat can cause discoloration 
and breakage. Your turquoise birthstone can be damaged by acids, and it can be 
discolored by certain chemicals, cosmetics and even skin oils or perspiration. 
It’s safe to clean turquoise jewelry with warm, soapy water, but this 
December birthstone should never be cleaned with steam or ultrasonic cleaners. 
Heat or solvents can damage the treated surfaces on some turquoise.

Tanzanite Birthstone
Tanzanite Birthstone Meaning & History

Tanzanite may be a relative newcomer to the world of colored stones, but it was 
one of the most exciting gem discoveries of the 20th century. Blue stones 
emerging from Tanzania were identified as the mineral zoisite in 1962. Not 
until 1967, though, did prospectors locate the primary source for this December 
birthstone: the Merelani Hills. It was eventually named tanzanite in honor of 
its country of origin. The tanzanite birthstone is often described as 
“velvety,” mostly because of its deep and saturated color, which ranges 
from a pure rich blue to violet, with the blue considered most valuable.

Tiffany & Co. believed that tanzanite had international appeal and became its 
main distributor. In 1968, Tiffany launched a major advertising campaign to 
promote it. With its vivid colors, high clarity and potential for large cut 
stones, tanzanite quickly became a sensation. Today, it is not only a December 
birthstone, but it is also the gem for the 24th wedding anniversary.

diamonds.

Where Is Tanzanite Found?

The Merelani Hills of northern Tanzania is the only place on earth where 
tanzanite is mined comercially. Grass-covered hillsides, scrub brush, rocky 
soil and an occasional tree form the local landscape. In the major mechanized 
operations there, thousands of workers recover tanzanite from mines dug over a 
100 meters (more than 300 feet) deep into the earth. North of the mines tower 
the snow-covered slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro.

Tanzanite Birthstone Care & Cleaning

This December birthstone (6 to 7 on the Mohs scale of harness) is resistant to 
the effects of normal heat, light and common chemicals. Still, the December 
birthstone may crack if exposed to very high temperatures or sudden temperature 
changes, and it abrades easily. It can be attacked by hydrochloric and 
hydrofluoric acids.

Most tanzanite begins as brownish zoisite that is heat treated to produce the 
blue to violet hues that characterize this December birthstones. The resulting 
color is permanent, and there are no additional durability concerns.

Your tanzanite birthstone is best set in earrings or pendants. While not 
recommended for daily wear in a ring, with a protective mounting and some care 
this December birthstone can be an attractive special-occasion jewel.

Warm, soapy water is the best way to clean this December birthstone. Ultrasonic 
and steam cleaners are never recommended for tanzanite.

Zircon Birthstone
Zircon Birthstone Meaning & History

The origins of the word “zircon” have elicited colorful debate. Some 
scholars believe it comes from the Arabic word zarkun, meaning “cinnabar” 
or “vermilion.” Others think the source is the Persian word zargun, or 
“gold colored.” Considering the broad color palette for this December 
birthstone – red, orange, yellow, brown, green and blue – either derivation 
seems possible. Colorless zircon is known for its brilliance and flashes of 
multicolored light, called fire, which have resulted in centuries of confusion 
with diamond.

During the Middle Ages, this December birthstone was thought to lull one into a 
deep sleep and scare off evil spirits. In the Hindu religion, zircon alternates 
with hessonite garnet as one of the nine gems of the navaratna. When worn 
together, the nine gems protect the wearer and bring wealth, wisdom and good 
health.

Victorians had a fondness for blue zircon. Fine specimens can be found in 
English estate jewelry from the 1880s.

green, yellow, orange, red, and clear.

Sri Lanka's wealth of gems is legendary: Sapphire in various colors, ruby, 
alexandrite, spinel, tournamline, moonstone and quartz are some of the gem 
minerals unearthed there. So is the December birthstone zircon. Elahera, a 
region in central Sri Lanka, is one of the country’s most productive areas. 
Mountains, jungles and restless streams make for a dramatic landscape.

Australia’s Harts Range is known for producing zircon birthstones in 
yellow-brown, orangy brown, pink and purple. Go there and you’ll see open 
savannahs, dry stream beds and low-lying hills that meet the horizon. Zircon 
Hill is where this December birthstone is mined. The nearby city of Alice 
Springs is known for its outback culture, aboriginal art and quirky sporting 
events like a regatta race held in a dry river bed.

This December birthstone is often located near sapphire sources. In addition to 
Sri Lanka and Australia, countries where the two gems overlap include Myanmar, 
Vietnam and Cambodia.
Zircon Birthstone Care & Cleaning

Zircon ranges from 6 to 7.5 on the Mohs scale of hardness. It is commonly heat 
treated to produce blue and colorless varieties, as well as orange, yellow and 
red. The gem is generally stable when exposed to light, but some heat-treated 
stones may revert to their original colors (usually light brown) after 
prolonged exposure to bright light. Exposure to heat can alter the color of 
some zircon. This December birthstone is stable when exposed to chemicals.

Because zircon tends to abrade, it is best to avoid wearing it in rough 
conditions, such as while gardening, playing sports or doing dishes.

Clean your zircon using a soft brush and mild soap in warm water. Ultrasonic 
and steam cleaners are not recommended for this December birthstone.

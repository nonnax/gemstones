Sparkling with an internal fire all its own, diamond is one of the world’s 
most sought-after and adored gemstones. Those born in April are lucky enough to 
call this scintillating gem their birthstone, a symbol of clarity and strength. 
Diamond is so strong, in fact, that its name comes from the Greek word 
"adamas," which means “invincible” or “unbreakable.” The timeless charm 
of diamond was cherished long before it became the April birthstone, and the 
places where diamond comes from are as fascinating as the lore that surrounds 
it.

Diamond Birthstone

[## Diamond Birthstone Meaning & History]

[Diamonds were coveted by Indian royalty and the wealthy as early as the fourth 
century BCE. Later, caravans brought Indian diamonds and other exotic items to 
Venice. Diamonds became fashionable accessories for Europe's elite by the 
1400s.] The first diamond engagement ring on record was given by Archduke 
Maximillian of Austria to his betrothed, Mary of Burgundy, in 1477. Recent 
evidence supports the origin of the legendary 45.52 carat (ct) blue Hope 
diamond in India’s Golconda mining area and its sale to King Louis XIV of 
France (then known as the French Blue diamond) in 1668.

[In the early 1700s, India's diamond supplies began to decline. Brazil then 
dominated the diamond market for more than 150 years.] Diamonds were discovered 
when gold miners sifted through gravels on the banks of the Jequitinhonha River 
in Minas Gerais. Brazil dominated the diamond market for more than 150 years.

The discovery of diamonds near Kimberley, South Africa, in the late 1860s 
marked the beginning of the modern diamond market. [Entrepreneur Cecil Rhodes 
established De Beers Consolidated Mines in 1888 and by 1900 it had control of 
90 percent of the world's production of rough diamonds.] The largest diamond 
ever found – at 3,106 ct (621 grams) – was recovered from South Africa’s 
Premier mine in 1905. From it was cut the pear shaped 530 ct Cullinan I 
diamond, also known as the Great Star of Africa, which is now set in the Royal 
Sceptre with Cross and housed with the other Crown Jewels in the Tower of 
London.

An anonymous second-century poet maintained that this birthstone for April 
warded off the evil eye – a malevolent look believed to cause sickness, 
poverty and even death. [### The April birthstone was thought to have healing 
powers. The diamond was thought to be an antidote to poison and a protection 
against the plague. Some people claim that it is good for longevity, strength, 
beauty and happiness. Diamonds are the gift of choice for the 60th and 75th 
wedding anniversaries. The diamond engagement ring is a universal symbol of 
love and marriage.]

[## Where is Diamond Found?]

[(Diamond:april-birthstone-diamond-1280x550.jpg)]

The birthstone for April is now mined around the world. [South Africa and other 
African nations were major producers of rough diamonds. The Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and Botswana are included. Russia is one of the top producers by 
both volume and value, and its first major mine opened in 1960.The opening of 
the Argyle mine in Australia in 1983 and the discovery of diamond deposits in 
northern Canada in the 1990s expanded diamond mining.]

Diamond mining in Russia’s eastern Siberia reads like an adventure novel. The 
setting: tundra, frigid temperatures and short days. The props: jet engines and 
explosives used to heat and soften the ice covering the kimberlite pipes – 
vertical, carrot shaped masses of igneous rock that can be a primary source for 
diamonds. The storyline: In 2013, Alrosa, Russia’s main diamond mining 
company, estimated that there were 970 million carats still waiting to be found 
in the frozen tundra.

Diamonds in Botswana lie in the typically hot, semi-arid eastern region of the 
country. These prolific mines have brought a boom to the economy, creating a 
growing middle class. The country is also a diamond hub, where approximately 40 
percent of the world’s supply of rough diamonds are sorted and valued.
The April birthstone, diamond can be found in Canada’s Diavik diamond mine, a 
sub-arctic landscape of open-pit mines surrounded by a lake.

[## Diamond Birthstone Care & Cleaning]

[Diamond is usually durable enough to be placed in an Ultrasonic cleaner. If 
you have a diamond that has been treated, it is best to clean it with a 
lint-free cloth, warm water, mild soap, and a soft toothbrush.] Also, have your 
diamond birthstone jewelry periodically cleaned and its setting examined by a 
professional jeweler to maintain its beauty and integrity over time.

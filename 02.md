{If you were born in February, you will have the purple variety of quartz 
called amethyst. It can be cut into many shapes and sizes and can also be 
manufactured in a lab. The royal families of Europe and Asia have collections 
of Amethyst, the February birthstone.} Now it’s within reach of most 
consumers. Consider buying a stunning amethyst for the king or queen of your 
heart – or treat yourself to a royal present. {If your birthday is in 
February, wearing an amethyst can be a sign of personal empowerment.}

Amethyst Birthstone
Amethyst Birthstone Meaning & History

{The Greek word for a remedy against drunkenness is what inspired the name 
"amethyst". Bacchus, the god of wine was associated with the gem because of its 
wine-like color.}

{## The wearer of the Amethyst would be clear headed in battle and business 
affairs. Europeans thought it calmed lovers.}

{The sixth wedding anniversary is when the Amethyst gem is given. It can be 
worn in celebration of your wedding or February's birthstone. You will be in 
royal company.}: Catherine the Great (Empress Catherine II of Russia, 
1729–1796) had a penchant for the gem and decked herself in amethyst 
necklaces, earrings and other ornaments. The famous jewelry connoisseur Wallis, 
Duchess of Windsor (1896–1986), made a memorable statement when she wore a 
lavish Cartier-designed amethyst bib necklace to a gala in Versailles in 1953.

The Duchess of Windsor’s amethyst necklace boasts the February birthstone 
with 28 step-cut amethysts, a large heart-shaped amethyst, turquoise cabochons, 
and diamonds supported by a gold chain.

as turquoise cabochons and brilliant cut diamonds, all suspended from a

{Historically, since the days of Alexander the Great, royals have admired the 
deep purple hue of the February birthstone. The lore of the Amethyst states 
that it would convey strength and wit to those who wore it.} If you celebrate a 
February birthday, wearing an amethyst can be a symbol of personal empowerment 
and inner strength.

{## Where is Amethyst Found?}

{Russia was the main source of the mineral until large deposits were found in 
Brazil. It was suddenly in abundance. Africa and South America are the most 
important sources of amethyst today.} Brazil is still a major supplier, 
especially its southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul, though the rough amethyst 
mined there tends to have a lighter color than amethyst found in other 
countries. Amethyst from Brazil sometimes forms in hollow, crystal-lined geodes 
so large you can stand in them.

The Anahí mine in Bolivia is another prominent source for amethyst. Hidden in 
the Pantanal wetlands, the Anahí mine is shrouded in fascinating lore. It was 
discovered by a Spanish conquistador in the 1600s, given to him as dowry when 
he married Anahí (a princess from the Ayoreo tribe), forgotten for three 
centuries, and rediscovered in the 1960s. The Anahí mine is also famous in gem 
circles as the source of the unusual bicolored amethyst-citrine crystals called 
ametrine.

In Africa, Zambia’s Kariba mine is one of the largest amethyst producers in 
the world. Amethyst mined there tends to be of superb quality with richly 
saturated colors.

{Amethyst is also found in the United States outside Phoenix, Arizona.} The 
Four Peaks amethyst mine is located high in the most rugged part of the 
Mazatzal Mountains. A remote location, hot summer temperatures, and a lack of 
water and power at the mine make for challenging conditions. Yet this jagged, 
arid, rattlesnake-infested terrain produces some very fine dark purple and 
purplish red amethyst crystals.

{## Amethyst Birthstone Care & Cleaning}

{Amethyst is a 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness. It is appropriate for daily use 
in rings and other jewelry, but may show wear and need repolishing over time. 
If you place your jewelry next to the harder stones, it will be more likely to 
be scratched.}..

Heat treatment is the most common technique for improving the color and 
marketability of natural amethyst. Heat treatment can’t make pale amethyst 
darker, but it can lighten the color of very dark amethyst and make it more 
attractive. It can also remove unwanted brownish inclusions in some amethysts. 
Some amethyst turns yellow – to citrine – with heat treatment.

Heat treating amethyst results in a permanent change in color. However, 
submitting it to intense heat may render it slightly more brittle than usual, 
and care must be taken not to damage pointed faceted corners and sharp edges. 
Note, too, that excessive heat can remove the color entirely, and some amethyst 
fades with prolonged exposure to strong light. Though the color is stable with 
normal use, this is not a birthstone to wear to the beach every day.

{Amethyst birthstone jewelry can be cleaned with an ultrasonic cleaner. It is 
not recommended to steam clean birthstone jewelry. A soft brush is the safest 
option.}

As you shop for the February birthstone, you’ll also encounter lab-created 
amethyst. Having the same chemical and physical properties as its natural 
counterpart, synthetic amethyst has been known since the 1970s. In some cases, 
it is very difficult to distinguish natural from synthetic amethyst without 
access to advanced gemological testing. The GIA Laboratory can tell the 
difference, but many in the jewelry industry do not request testing because of 
the cost and time required to determine the origin of what is a comparatively 
inexpensive gem. Still, merchants are required to tell you if a gem is natural 
or synthetic.
